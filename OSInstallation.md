## OS Installation ##

The OS system we chose for development is SlugOS. The application might run in other OSs, but we haven't tested it.

To install SlugOS in the NSLU2 follow the instructions at http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/SlugOS/UsingTheBinary.


Due to the memory constraints of the Slug, you might also consider adding additional swap space http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/AddAdditionalSwapSpace
