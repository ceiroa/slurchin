#summary Current and planned functionality.


= Application Functionality =

The application can be currently considered a web interface for the w3camd application running in a NSLU2.

The application has been written in php, xhtml, and javascript, and currently does the following:

 # Checks if the necessary drivers to take pictures with a Quickcam for Notebooks Deluxe connected to a NSLU2 are loaded
 # If they are, it checks if the camera is in fact a Quickcam for Notebooks Deluxe (it might work for other cameras, but this is not implemented yet)
 # It allows the user to take pictures and see them on the web


== Planned functionality ==

 * Make the application work with other cameras
 * Add motion detection
 * Add night vision
 * Create a RESTful protocol that can be used to alert emergency services
